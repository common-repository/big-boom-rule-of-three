Easily build responsive blocks of content for your site

== Description ==

Create your content blocks on the plugin settings page and then use shortcode `[rule-of-three]` to insert the content you create anywhere on your site.  The plugin provides several options as to how your blocks will be displayed on the front end:

* None: Minimal styling so you can potentially add your own
* Drop Shadow: Adds 3D drop shadow to each image
* Nested:  Best for blocks with short or no description. Layers text on top of image
* Circle: Automatically displays images as circular without altering the actual image files
* Bar: Adds customizable color bar under the header
* Font Awesome: Allows you to choose any font awesome icon instead of using an image

See screenshots for examples of the different styling options.

Additional Features:

* Easily add a title, image/icon, description, and link to each block of content for an instant call-to-action section
* Load existing content using your pages, posts, or custom post types
* Use a color picker utility to easily select a primary accent color to match your site
* Includes an option to select a hover effect for the rule of three images or icons
* Option to include "Read More" link with each block

For best results, make sure the images you use for each content block have the same aspect ratio.
